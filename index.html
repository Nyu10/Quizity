                </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
                <ul><p>We used a lot of python files as backend and they get information, use, interpret, and save them. Then it prints the html
                code for that page with required information. The homepage is a regular html file. We have three sections: make a quiz, take a quiz,
                and show results of the quiz.
                        </p>

                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">MAKING THE QUIZ</li>
                                <p> For make the quiz, we take the data you enter: Quiz Name, Quiz ID and number of questions, and redirects the information
                                to a python file. We take the number of questions to print the template for amount of questions you need. For this, we just used
                                a while loop for how many questions there were and changed the value of the information (HTML input values). Once you are done adding
                                the questions and answers, we save answers and questions into a csv file with a unique number for identification. The six-digit
                                number is generated randomly. We have a list of used ID to prevent repetition. After submitting the question, you will see a
                                confirmation page with an assigned ID. If you are ready to create the quiz, press on Go Live. Our code leads to a page with a
                                page that confirms the completion of your quiz along with the Quiz ID and PIN so that the information will be saved onto the
                                server and so that you can jot it down.
                                </p>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">TAKING THE QUIZ</li>
                                <p> When you want to take a quiz, you have to input the Quiz ID and your name. We take the ID and open the data about the quiz
                                from the csv file printed it out (through changing the cvs to various dictionaries and lists) in an html format that would allow
                                you to actually answer the questions using a selection list. After you take the quiz, another python file checks your answers
                                with the correct answers that the creator has. It then prints out  your score as a percentage of correct answers along with a
                                table with all the questions. Questions that you answered wrong will be in red.
                                </p>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">SEEING THE RESULTS</li>
                                <p> The results page takes all the data taken from quiz takers for a particular quiz. It is saved from they submit the check
                                in a csv format. It uses the data to calculate various types of statistics and prints the results in a table. The page will
                                also have the name and scores of the user in a two-column table for easy viewing (ordered in alphabetical order).
